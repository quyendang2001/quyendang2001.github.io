I am passionate about High Performance Computing, which focuses on improving the speed and efficiency of solving large and complex systems in mathematical engineering. These systems are often highly nonlinear, making them challenging to solve in desired time. My work involves developing advanced methods to tackle these situations.

By leveraging these methodological works, I also seek to significantly boost the performance and applicability of numerical solvers (mainly implemented in Julia) for industry applications, such as in energy sectors.
